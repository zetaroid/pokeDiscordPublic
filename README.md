## FAQ
* How long did this take to make?
  * Two weeks worth of my time outside of work and sleep.
* Why isn't this a publicly available bot?
  * Besides not having a proper place to host it, this bot has a major limitation where more than 1 concurrent user at a time slows it down significantly.
* Will PVP be added?
  * Probably not, I made a mess of the battle code and not sure it's feasible.
* Can you add gen4-7 Pokemon?
  * Not immediately evident, but I already did.
* Is there a move relearner/TM's?
  * I have plans...stay tuned.
* Can X be added?
  * Idk, ask me though!
* Why doesn't [insert move here] work as intended?
  * Because I didn't implement it. If you want it to work bad enough, shoot me a message.
* HELP! My game is really laggy!
  * I blame my free hosting site. Or Discord. Or Notch from Minecraft.
