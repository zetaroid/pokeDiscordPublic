## FAQ
* What is this bot?
  * This bot is full Pokemon RPG experience on Discord where you play through a full length Pokemon game based on Pokemon Emerald. It includes exploration, battles, gyms, PVP, trading, Battle Tower, and more!
* How do I save?
  * Game autosaves, you do not need to do anything.
  * By default, you will have one global save. If you want separate save files per server, use `!disableGlobalSave`.
* I'm confused on where to go.
  * Please see: [Game Guide](#Game-Guide)
* How long did this take to make?
  * I have been working on this since February 2021.
* Is there PVP?
  * Yes! 
  * For PVP against another user on your server, use `!battle @user`
  * For matchmaking, use `!pvp`
  * When participating in PVP, your Pokemon will temporarily be raised to level 100.
* What is the shiny rate?
  * 1/200, and yes NPC trainers can have shiny Pokemon too (I'm sorry).
  * There are second form of shinies called "distortions" that have 1/10,000 odds.
* Can I catch legendaries?
  * Yes. And you can shiny hunt them.
* Can you catch gen 4-7 Pokemon?
  * You can catch any non-legendary gen 1-7 Pokemon in Altering Cave after you beat the Elite 4. You can alter the Pokemon there with '!setAlteringCave' in exchange for 10 BP (BP is earned at the Battle Tower or from raids).
* Are there Mega Evolutions/Z-moves/Dynamax?
  * Although none of these are in game, Mega forms can be obtained by purchasing a Mega Stone from the `!shop` with BP the changing form with the `!changeForm` command.
* Is there a move relearner/TM's?
  * Lilycove City has both.
* Can you add gen8 Pokemon?
  * They are slowly being released as events.
* Can [insert request here] be added?
  * Maybe, maybe not, ask me though!
* Why doesn't [insert move here] work as it does in the main series?
  * I decided not to implement certain moves like Foresight that are rarely ever used. If there is enough demand for some of these moves in the future, I will gladly take the time to add them.
  * Some moves, like Hyper Beam, do not take a turn to recharge but have had their power reduced to compensate.
* Can I get help or get involved?
  * We have a [support server](https://discord.gg/HwYME4Vwj9) you can join to get help / contact the developer. 
  * The support server also has a channel for suggestions for the bot.
  * In terms of involvement, we are not particularly looking for development support, but definitely could use some help promoting the bot.
